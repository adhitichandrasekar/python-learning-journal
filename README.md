# Python Learning Journal
This journal serves as a personal space to document the Python programs I create and track my growth as a programmer over time. It’s exciting to see how far I’ll come!

## About Me
Hello! My name is Adhiti Chandrasekar. I’m embarking on my Python learning journey with enthusiasm and curiosity. I hope to not only understand the fundamentals but also create projects that are both practical and enjoyable. Other than Python, I enjoy coding in Java, swimming, and reading.

## Goals for This Course
- Build a strong foundation in Python programming concepts.
- Develop clean, readable, and efficient code.
- Apply my knowledge through hands-on projects and challenges.
- Cultivate problem-solving skills by tackling real-world scenarios.

## My First Python Program
Here’s a simple program that marks the beginning of my coding adventure:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
